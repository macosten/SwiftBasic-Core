# SwiftBasic-Core
**This project is a work in progress.** I'm confident that this is still riddled with bugs. If you find one, don't be afraid to file an issue.

A dialect of Basic written in Swift, mostly inspired by [cvharihan's Basic](https://github.com/cvhariharan/Tiny-Basic).

There are a few differences, though:

* Variables can store Ints or Doubles.
	* Any math done with a Double will evaluate to a Double.

* Text labels are supported in addition to traditional integer labels.

* Variable names beyond just single letters are possible - you can even use emoji, if you're into that.
